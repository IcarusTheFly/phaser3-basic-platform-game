# Phaser 3 Basic Platform Game

A Phaser 3 basic platform game with ES6 support via [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/). The following tutorial has been followed: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## How to start the game

  1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
  2. Run `npm start` to actually start the local development. After this, you can edit any files in the `src` folder and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080` by default).
  
You can also run `npm run build` to build the code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc...)
